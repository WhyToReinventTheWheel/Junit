JUnit
-----

	JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding".
	This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little." 
	It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, 
	which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.
